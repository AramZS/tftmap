## My ideal thinking tool(s) 

One tool which supports me in reading, note-making, writing and publishing without forcing me to invest major time in becoming a power user and/or taking expensive courses. In an ideal world it would also handle my todos and time.

How close is my current system (below) to this ideal? Not at all.

## My current tools and practices

* I use  [[inbox curation]] to identify high-priority sources of content: in [[gmail]] I auto-label high-priority [[enewsletter]], and I maintain a [[twitter list]]
* I use [[GTD]]: I have recurring [[calendar]] items and tasks to [[scan]] priority sources; [[queue]] the best content to read to [[pocket]]; read, [[annotate]] and [[tag]] the best content into [[myhub]]
* I also use [[progressive summarisation]] to better embed the knowledge,  via [[zettelkasten]] overviews in [[myhub]], [[enewsletter]] editions and original posts.
* I put all other notes into [[roam]], almost always starting with the [[daily note]].
* I publish via [[myhub]], medium and my [[newsletter]].
