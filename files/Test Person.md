## My current tools and techniques

_borrowed from [[Mathew Lowry]]_

* I use  [[inbox curation (technique)]] to identify high-priority sources of content: in [[gmail (tool)]] I auto-label high-priority [[enewsletter (technique)]], and I maintain a [[twitter list (technique)]]
* I use [[GTD (technique)]]: I have recurring [[calendar (tool)]] items and tasks to [[scan (technique)]] priority sources; [[queue (technique)]] the best content to read to [[pocket (tool)]]; read, [[annotate (technique)]] and [[tag (technique)]] the best content into [[myhub (tool)]]
* I also use [[progressive summarisation (technique)]] to better embed the knowledge,  via [[zettelkasten (technique)]] overviews in [[myhub (tool)]], [[enewsletter (technique)]] editions and original posts.
* I put all other notes into [[roam (tool)]], almost always starting with the [[daily note (technique)]].
* I publish via [[myhub (tool)]], medium and my [[newsletter]].
