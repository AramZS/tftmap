# Outline Alternative Project plan - v1
This is an alternative to [[Project plan]]: it  presupposes that:
* getting the site working as described will actually be a lot of work
* this workload is not worth embarking on until sufficient interest in the project has been demonstrated
* therefore the aim is to create a mockup of the site first.

*to be continued*
