# Outline Alternative Project plan - v1
This is an alternative to [[Project plan]]: it  presupposes that:
* getting the site working as described will actually be a lot of work
* this workload is not worth embarking on until sufficient interest in the project has been demonstrated
* therefore the aim is to create a mockup of the site first.

The key changes vis a vis [[Project plan]] are:
* in Build: rather than "Get the site working, so anyone can see how the actual map could look", create a mockup *imitating* a working site
* In Launch 1: after "assess interest" - if interest is high enough, get the site working.
