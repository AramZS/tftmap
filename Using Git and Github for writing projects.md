	I was involved as an editor in several collaborative writing projects in the past year: I edited two [objc.io issues](https://www.objc.io/issues/), and I was the technical reviewer for the [Core Data](https://www.objc.io/books/core-data/) and [Advanced Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/) books. I’d like to tell you a bit about my experiences. ... The editing process for the books worked like this: The authors would write chapters in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and push directly to a private repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

    Botvinnik managed her paper as if it were open-source software. She wrote it in a plain-text editor and placed text files alongside data sets and code for generating figures on the code-sharing site GitHub. She invited her four co-authors to submit edits using Git, software that tracks precisely how and when a file has been changed. And she used a dedicated tool called Manubot to render the document as a user-friendly manuscript, which she then published online and tweeted to the world.
