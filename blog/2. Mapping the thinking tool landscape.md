# Mapping the thinking tool landscape 

**Help us create a map of thinking tools and techniques using decentralised tools.**

_This is one in a series of posts derived from my upcoming book chapter on Personal Knowledge Graphs, with some of the ideas and side-avenues I discovered along the way that I couldn’t fit in. You can find_ [_all related posts_](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?quality=all&tags=pkgbook&timeframe=anytime&types=think) _(indeed,_ [_all related content_](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=pkgbook)_) on my Hub._

The Fellowship of the Link is launching some pilot projects to explore and demonstrate decentralised solutions to collective intelligence:

We’re looking for knowledge contributions to our first pilot project, which focuses on a knowledge domain loved by its inhabitants and confusing as hell to everyone else: thinking tools (here’s why: [Why you probably won’t use that thinking tool the same way as anyone else](https://medium.com/@mathewlowry/why-you-probably-wont-use-that-thinking-tool-the-same-way-as-anyone-else-bc5b8f7b5306)).

If your first reaction is “_What the hell are thinking tools?_”, this post is not for you, but the pilot project outcome will be: a map of this software class designed to help newcomers navigate it and find the right combination of tools and techniques to get started.

## How the map will look 

If the map was an iceberg, the tip showing above water would be a **spidergraph** (_top in the figure, below_) mapping various tools’ strengths and weaknesses along axes such as user-friendliness, openness, etc. Users can then simply define the strengths most important to them to identify a shortlist of tools best matching their needs.

Numbers on a spidergraph are great, but even better are the stories behind them. Users will therefore be able to dive under the waterline to explore a knowledge graph, composed of three sorts of file:

### **Personal profiles (bottom)**

This is what we need current users of thinking tools to submit, following the template. It includes an About Me section, their scores for the tools they use (automatically added to the spidergraph) and short bulletpoints describing how they combine their thinking tools and productivity techniques . Each tool and technique mentioned is a wikilink, and so links to the dedicated Tool and Technique pages, next.

### **Tool page (lower right)**

The template includes a brief description of a thinking tool, and automatically pulls relevant bullet points from all Personal profiles, thus linking to all the people who both contributed to the map _and_ use this tool. Tool pages are are also linked from the spidergraph.

### **Technique page** (lower left)

A brief description of a productivity technique, such as inbox curation or zettelkasten. Again, the template automatically pulls in relevant bullet points from the Personal profiles of people using the technique.

> explore a map of how different people use and combine thinking tools and techniques

A user starting with the spidergraph’s shortlist of thinking tools can thus discover not just the tools themselves, but explore a map of how different people use and combine it with other tools and techniques.

## Why go to all this trouble?

The above architecture would be pretty easy to pull together using any modern content management system on a centralised server. But we don’t want to do that.

In addition to helping people navigate the world of thinking tools and related productivity techniques, [we want to explore how collective intelligence like this can be created using decentralised tools](https://medium.com/@mathewlowry/building-collective-intelligence-from-social-knowledge-graphs-e3a465852e8b). That means people being able to create knowledge with the tools _they_ want to use, and publishing it in the places _they_ want to publish, while also allowing the knowledge to be knitted together: in this case, creating a map.

## How do we do this?

**We’re currently exploring the use of** [**massive.wiki**](https://massive.wiki/)**, but we’re open to other suggestions: pilot projects, after all, test different ideas and tools.**

### Massive.wiki
With massive.wiki, a network of editors can work on local copies of the wiki’s contents using Obsidian (or any other markup editor), and push them to a website using a dedicated publishing template via GitHub. Git therefore provides version control, with GitHub providing a layer of collaboration tools to allow the editors to discuss edits right down to individual lines.

I immediately loved the idea, as it provides a first example of one of the building blocks I'm looking for: a thinking tool which is simultaneously:
* **home base for your social knowledge graph**, where you can share selected 'private' notes with  your friends: simply set a note's visibility to "Friends", or even a named group of selected Friends, and it will appear in *their* thinking tool
* **seamlessly integrated with your public web presence**: simply set a note's visibility to "Public", and it's live.

*Massive Wiki Conceptual Diagram*

Even better, it allows users to collaborate on both private and public notes, opening up features such as forking and wiki-ising your notes with friends.

Building the thinking tools map with massive.wiki is therefore simple: 
* anyone can submit their Personal Profile to the Repository in the form of a markdown file, following the template,
* or you could  just email it to us
* those who want to contribute more - for example, to edit a tool or technique page - can simply synch Obsidian with the GitHub repository and submit updates
* at the other end of the spectrum, we'll offer users unfamiliar or unwilling to edit markup files with an online form, although that may need some manual post-processing if they introduce new tools or techniques.

### Not ready for primetime
My first experience with massive.wiki, however, was a classic example of how unready decentralised collective intelligence tools are for prime-time: Obsidian plays with Git via a plugin which I couldn’t get to work. I’m not alone with this problem, but the plugin developer simply refers people to Obsidian’s Discord channel. Hunting through that for useful knowledge forcefully reminded me of a 2014 post from my personal vault: [All stream, no memory, zero innovation](https://myhub.ai/items/all-stream-no-memory-zero-innovation). 

This is an endemic problem in this space: there’s little chance of any technology going anywhere near the mainstream if users must already understand two technologies (Obsidian and GitHub), *and* must be able to get the plugin that allows them to talk to each other to work, with zero support.

But that, of course, is the whole point. By pushing this forward we will provide massive.wiki with a test case, demonstrate a collective intelligence tool, and develop a map which will make it easier for new users to fing their way in the thinking tool space, indirectly enlarging the user base.

Which is why I didn't get zero support. After a three-hour coaching session from massive.wiki co-creators [[Peter Kaminski]] and [[Bill Anderson]], I wa underway.... TO BE FINISHED

So right now we’re struggling with massive.wiki and evaluating other options. **Join us on the [ogm] Town Square Mattermost channel if you’d like to suggest another method, or just want to join in.**
