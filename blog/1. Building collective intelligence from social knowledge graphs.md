# Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs
![[Pasted image 20221001182714.png]]

**Writing a chapter for a book on Personal Knowledge Graphs made me rethink MyHub.ai: what it is, the wider ecosystem it could thrive in, and how that ecosystem could support global collective intelligence.**

_This is the first in a series of posts derived from my chapter, with some of the ideas and side-avenues I discovered along the way that I couldn’t fit in. You can find_ [_all posts_](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?quality=all&tags=pkgbook&timeframe=anytime&types=think) _(indeed,_ [_all content_](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=pkgbook)_) related to my book chapter on my Hub._

I originally planned to use the book editors’ deadline to force myself to flesh out detailed MyHub.ai user requirements, complete with clickable wireframes. But that was before a co-author invited me to join the [Fellowship of the Link](https://www.fellowshipofthelink.org/) (FotL). 

I kid you not: that’s actually what we call ourselves, probably only half-ironically. We’re simply a bunch of people interested in collective intelligence, but collectively they taught me something I once knew but somehow forgot: that one of the best ways to think things through and discover new ideas is to simply talk with others with the same interests. Blame the pandemic: I’ve spent too long alone with my ideas.

I completely rewrote my chapter as I realised just how many people were already working on different aspects of collective intelligence (TL:DR; the basic tools are taking shape, but they’re not linked together and the users are absent). My chapter, as a result, now uses MyHub.ai merely as an example of one app in a wider ecosystem. **What matters is the ecosystem:** owned by a data union composed of its users, and generating revenue for its own development to boost global collective intelligence.

## Collective intelligence

Collective intelligence is commonly understood as a large group of people sharing their knowledge, data and skills to solve common problems. 25 years ago we all thought this would emerge naturally from ever-increasing Web adoption, but our models at the time ignored that collaboration requires more than just information: it requires trust.

Instead, the opposite seems to have happened: we’re effectively stupider as a race than we were when we saved the ozone layer, something we’d probably not manage today despite access to vastly more information.

A lot of people seem to think the rot set in when Google closed its RSS Reader software in 2013. RSS was a critical piece of the OpenWeb plumbing which was supposed to underpin collective intelligence, but although Reader’s closure undoubtedly accelerated the decline, it was itself a symptom of a deeper problem.

My alarm bells started ringing a few years earlier, as conversations migrated off the decentralised blogosphere and onto centralised walled gardens of surveillance capitalism. The continuous innovation of the Web’s first 10–15 years slowed as the platforms’ grip strengthened and people refocused on maximising their content’s performance on these platforms, rather than publishing their own.

While built on top of open Internet standards, Facebook _et al_ are anything but open, enclosing the vast majority of ideas published today, along with the people who both have them _and_ could use them. Sloshing between this archipelago of walled gardens lies a sea of political disinformation and business-driven crap content, lowering the signal-to-noise to the point where noone can find the solutions we collectively need. 

Solving this mess and improving collective intelligence is thus a decentralised knowledge management problem. We’ll need new ideas. The grip of those walled gardens, however, is now a stranglehold on innovation.

## Fragmented community, decentralised tools

**A lot of people are nevertheless working on solutions. Individually.**

It turns out that a lot of people are nevertheless working on solutions, but because collective intelligence is such a multifaceted concept no two solutions look alike. Each person is working on their own innovation in their own corner. Some, like Gordon Brander’s [Subconscious](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/second-subconscious) or Marc-Antoine’s [HyperKnowledge](https://hyperknowledge.org/), foresee new protocols, while others (Flancian’s [Agora](https://anagora.org/index), [Massive.wiki](https://massive.wiki/), [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)) use existing tools and standards as diverse as Webmentions and Git. I’m still trying to get my head around [Urbit](https://urbit.org/blog/urbit-for-normies), which appears to be trying to singlehandedly build an entire ecosystem.

And MyHub.ai? I hadn’t actually looked at MyHub.ai through the specific lens of collective intelligence until the Fellowship conversations, but the basic idea was already there in my first draft introduction:

> “The MyHub.ai Social Knowledge Graph is thus your personal Knowledge Graph, connected to the Knowledge Graphs of those whose opinion and judgement you respect via a writing-oriented thinking tool”  
> - [From Personal to Social Knowledge Graphs: a vision statement](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/from-personal-to-social-knowledge-graphs-a-vision-statement-draft-fc86ef4f7022)

All solutions have one thing in common: they are **decentralised in nature**, foreseeing a world where:

-   users publish their own content in their own way using whatever tools they want
-   knowledge interoperability allows this content, published across the web, to be knitted together to help solve problems.

The key problem is that everyone, like me, is focused on their own personal vision, whereas if any of us are to succeed we _must_ work together. After all, our tools must talk to each other.

So it’s beautifully ironic: to overcome the fragmentation separating us we need the collective intelligence toolkit we’re trying to build.

## Bootstrapping upwards

One way forward that emerged in our calls is to bootstrap ourselves upwards. We’d like to see a series of pilot experiments where:

-   the tools we have today are used to link ideas in a specific domain (and the people behind them) together in a decentralised way
-   in the process demonstrating decentralised collective intelligence
-   we learn from the experience to create a new iteration of slightly better tools as a result, along with a slightly bigger audience,
-   rinse, repeat.

I suggested a first experiment should focus on thinking tools: check out our initial ideas in [Mapping the thinking tool landscape](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/9b5cd00a6309). If it succeeds, the current thinking is to cover Pattern Languages in experiment 2.
