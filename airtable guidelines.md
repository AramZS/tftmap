# airtable guidelines (deprecated)

## What is this page for?

In version 1 of this site we are opening up the discussion of how this project should measure Tools for Thought. As set out in [[measuring thinking tools]]:
* this is unlikely to be an easy balance. 
* we started from a "martyr draft" and then moved the discussion to airtable.com

This page sets out how you can contribute to this conversation on airtable.com and help us define these dimensions before we move to Phase 2.

## Revision Notes

* this page will be deprecated as we won't be asking users to comment on airtable
* This is a stub, to be developed for version 1 (meaningful glance at @peter ;) )
