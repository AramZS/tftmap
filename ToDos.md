# ToDos
(ML) *This is a braindump in prep for our next meeting*: please do not see this as instructions, but as me trying to get my thoughts down for discussion when we meet.

## Next actions

### Massive wiki team
Read and comment on the ideas to date:
* how the site will work: see [[About]]
* [[Project plan]]
* site structure, home page ideas: see [[README]] (is a wireframe needed?)


### ML
In no particular order (yet):
* align various inputs (Bill Setz, Bentley/CDL, etc.) for spidergraph dimensions
* draft first versions of of [[How to use]], [[How to contribute]]

### Together
flesh out [[Project plan]]
