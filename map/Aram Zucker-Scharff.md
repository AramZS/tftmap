## My current tools and practices

* I am bad at using email but I try to handle it using [[GTD]].
* I sign up to every newsletter I encounter, then process it through custom code called Backreads to find significant links. 
* I use [[Feedly]] as a feed reader. 
* I mostly interact with Twitter through [[twitter list]]s.
* All my note-taking happens in [[Obsidian]] and occasionally [[VSCode]]. 
* I use [[PressForward]] to retain text archives of important links and reference material. I am one of the primary developers of this tool. 
* I use [[11ty]] to generate context sites that I use to store, categorize and archive contextually-related blocks of information. 
* I feed [[Instapaper]], [[Twitter]], and [[Mastodon]] into [[Pinboard]] for easy search and link finding. 
* I use [[Instapaper]] to build an article-reading queue. 
* I use [[GoodReads]] to build a book-reading queue.  
* I use [[Letterboxd]] to build a movie-watching queue. 
* I want something to build a TV-watching queue. 
* I use [[Are.na]] for storing design ideas from other sites. 
* I publish via [[WordPress]], [[11ty]], [[Substack]] and [[Jekyll]]
* I use [[folder structure]] and [[tagging]] as techniques to keep my [[Obsidian]] notes organized. 
* I use [[Dropbox]], [[git]], [[GitHub]], [[Obsidian]] mobile, and [[FolderSync]] to keep my notes synced between devices.
