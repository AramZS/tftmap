*some notes from Mattermost a couple of weeks ago, to be replaced when the [[Project plan]] is final*

**Here are a few thoughts on the TfT Map, riffing off Friday's conversation.**

# Capture the stories as well as the scores

Getting numbers for the spidergraph is great, but even better are the stories behind the numbers.

I've uploaded to this GDrive 4 example .md files, plus a screenshot of them and this guide. 

The 4 examples fall into three types:
* a personal profile - eg [[Mathew Lowry]]. Ideally everyone who rates the tools for the spidergraph provides something like this,  as each profile ties the other two types of file together with a story about how a real person actually uses them. 
* two types of zettelkasten overview
	* technique: this describes a thinking tool technique, like [[inbox curation]] or [[progressive summarisation]]. It includes a brief description, link(s) and an automatically created list of the people who use this technique, along with the associated block from their profile describing how they use it
	* tool: similar to a technique, but describes a thinking tool, like #roam. Along with the automated list of people profiles which use it, it inclused **the scores they gave it** (only actual scores included)

Each tool or technique tag links to the zettelkasten overview, where users get both a description and links to explore how people use it.
 
# How to get these stories and scores? 

## Profiles
Obviously, many people who could contribute to this map are able to create their own profiles in .md following some basic guidelines. Those guidelines will probably need to include canonical lists of #tools and #techniques (below).

Ideally, they'd publish their files on their own servers, and have some sort of underlay magic *a la anagora* pull it all together. Can Flancian spool up a dedicated instance for this map, and will the  result be user-friendly?

However, at least some won't actually have their own hosting environment, so we'd also need to provide a **Main Repository** to which they could submit their file(s). Ideally this Main Repository would allow them to edit them post-submission (*github, wiki, shared Obsidian vault?*).

Finally, we could even set up a questionnaire using google forms or similar which would output to a file which could be post-processed into an .md and put in the Main Repository. And then we can give the respondent edit access to it.

## Tools and Technique overviews
I'd suggest we manage two canonical lists:
* the tools set out in spidergraph v1, so we avoid seeing  both roam.md and a roamresearch.md files created
* a first set of techniques

We ask everyone to use the terms from the lists when editing their profiles, so their profiles link where they should. 

At launch, we create a file for each term, even if only a stub, in the main repo.  Contributors can edit them.

If contributors want to add a new tool or technique, they simply include the link to it when they submit their profile, thus creating a stub (tbd?). Ideally also submit a new file called "a_ _new_tool.md".

## This is a Saturday morning braindump
I'm sure it can be improved.
