# Capture the stories as well as the scores

**Getting numbers for the spidergraph is great, but even better are the stories behind the numbers.**

This is an edited version of the first post I made to Mattermost proposing a structure for the thinking tool map set out in [2. Mapping the thinking tool landscape](app://obsidian.md/2.%20Mapping%20the%20thinking%20tool%20landscape):
# How to get these stories and scores? 

## Profiles
Obviously, many people who could contribute to this map are able to create their own profiles in .md following some basic guidelines. Those guidelines will probably need to include canonical lists of #tools and #techniques (below).

Ideally, they'd publish their files on their own servers, and have some sort of underlay magic *a la anagora* pull it all together. Can Flancian spool up a dedicated instance for this map, and will the  result be user-friendly?

However, at least some won't actually have their own hosting environment, so we'd also need to provide a **Main Repository** to which they could submit their file(s). Ideally this Main Repository would allow them to edit them post-submission (*github, wiki, shared Obsidian vault?*).

Finally, we could even set up a questionnaire using google forms or similar which would output to a file which could be post-processed into an .md and put in the Main Repository. And then we can give the respondent edit access to it.

## Tools and Technique overviews
I'd suggest we manage two canonical lists:
* the tools set out in spidergraph v1, so we avoid seeing  both roam.md and a roamresearch.md files created
* a first set of techniques

We ask everyone to use the terms from the lists when editing their profiles, so their profiles link where they should. 

At launch, we create a file for each term, even if only a stub, in the main repo.  Contributors can edit them.

If contributors want to add a new tool or technique, they simply include the link to it when they submit their profile, thus creating a stub (tbd?). Ideally also submit a new file called "a_ _new_tool.md".

## This is a Saturday morning braindump
I'm sure it can be improved.
