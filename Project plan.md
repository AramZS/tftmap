# Project plan
This is one of several plans. It presupposed that we can actually get the site working before we show it to anyone. This is therefore not a good plan if the "preparation" phase is too onerous - see [[alternative project plan]].

## Preparation
* Get it working, so anyone can see how the actual site would look
* Test it by adding our profiles, tools and techniques
* Fine-tune, create [[known issues]]
* create Documentation: v1 (understandable by FoTL/OGM community)

## Launch 1: FoTL/OGM
* post an invite to Town Square & elsewhere on Mattermost
* assess interest
* support early adopters
* refine in light of feedback
	* actual site
	* documentation, creating v2

## Launch 2: Friends of friends
* Widen the circle of invitees to other people we know interested in the field.
* as above:  assess interest, support submitters. refine site, system & documentation

We might do this several times before the site is ready for...

## Launch 3: Full launch
### Optional: 
*This may be outside project scope, could come later.* 

Add a system allowing non Obsidian / GitHub users to 
* submit their profile
* add tools and technique files
* provide scores

### Promotion
Publish blog posts
Get all current contributors to help promote it
Assess interest

## Plan the next project
We should have plenty of ideas...
