# How can you comment on this site's content?

**In addition to contributing your own personal profile, tool and practice pages (see [[Contribute]]), you can also contribute comments to existing content.**

Collective intelligence tools should allow people to comment in a number of ways, but too many commenting features will make the site unusable, with conversations on the same content in multiple places. 

This is a pilot project, so we're both experimenting with different approaches and trying to find the right balance. Right now there are several options.

If you want to suggest a change to a page: 

* add a comment via the form at the bottom of the page?? to do
* or - if you have a hypothesis account (or want one) - leave a comment using hypothesis. 

If the resulting conversation shows a more substantial collaboration on the content is required, you (or we) can:

* set up the equivalent of a 'talk page' (cf wikipedia)
* create a dedicated object on a separate platform best suited for the discussion, ranging from hackmd.io to airtable.com
* contribute your version of the entire page (below)

## Contribute your version of the entire page

Arguably the most powerful, but also probably the most complex method, as it provides several options. 

As set out in [[Contribute]], as a massive.wiki contributor you can clone the GitHub repository to your machine, edit any file you like and submit it back to the repository, where:

* we can use GitHub's commenting function to discuss your edits line by line in GitHub.
* or we can simply publish your changes, if they are inserted as comments, so that others can see and comment on them in turn. **Please simply follow the paragraph you're commenting on with a new version, indented and preceded by your name.**
