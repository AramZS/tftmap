# How can you comment on this site's content?

**In addition to contributing your own personal profile, tool and practice pages (see [[Contribute]]), you can also contribute comments to existing content.**

Collective intelligence tools ~~should~~ allow people to comment in a number of ways, but too many commenting features will make the site unusable and fragment the conversation. 

This is a pilot project, so we're experimenting with different approaches. We currently support the following options:

* use the **comment form** at the bottom of the page;  
* or, you can contribute your version of the entire page (below)  

## Contribute your version of the entire page

Arguably the most powerful, but also probably the most complex method. 

As set out in [[Contribute]], you can clone this site's GitHub repository to your machine, edit any file you like and submit it back to the repository, where:

* we can use GitHub's commenting function to discuss your edits line by line in GitHub.
* or we can simply publish your changes, if they are inserted as comments, so that others can see and comment on them in turn. **Please simply follow the paragraph you're commenting on with a new version, indented and preceded by your name.**

## Revision Notes

2023-01-08: (WLA removed this entire section. We do not have plans to support this for Phase 1. Or do we?)

* If the resulting conversation shows a more substantial collaboration is required, we  (or you) can:
	* set up the equivalent of a 'talk page' (cf wikipedia)  
	* create a dedicated object on a separate platform best suited for the discussion, ranging from hackmd.io to airtable.com
