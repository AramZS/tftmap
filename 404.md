# Page Doesn't Exist Yet (404)

**You have followed a link to a page that has not yet been created, which would be a problem if this was a regular website.**

But this is a wiki, so chances are someone simply submitted a personal profile which mentioned a tool or technique that hasn't gotten its own page yet (see [[About]]).

## Currently you can:

* return to that page by clicking Back in your browser 
	* why not contact the author (if possible) and suggest they contribute the page?
* [[Contribute]] the page yourself?
* contact [[Mathew Lowry]] and let him know you'd like to see the page created (don't forget to mention which link you followed)
* or simply return to the [[README|Home]] page.

## In the future

We're investigating how massive.wiki can automatically create such pages using a "stub" template.

The template will be is similar to the [technique template](https://dainty-sable-264aa3.netlify.app/project/technique%20template) - it will include: 

* title: the name of the tool or technique mentioned in the personal profile
* description: a short text explaining that this page is missing both a description and type ("is it a tool? is it a template?)", so volunteers are welcome to contribute one (see [Contribute](https://dainty-sable-264aa3.netlify.app/project/Contribute.html)). 
* **People using this**: includes excerpt(s) from personal profiles mentioning the tool or technique. While there'll be only one such excerpt upon creation, others will appear if more personal profiles are submitted mentioning the same tool or technique. These people will be asked to submit a description, and define its type.
