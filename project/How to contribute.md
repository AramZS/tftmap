# How to contribute

**There will be several ways to contribute  Personal profiles, Tool and Pracrtice pages to the map.**

<<<<<<< HEAD:project/How to contribute.md
One of the key ideas underpinning collective intelligence is to not force everyone to contribute their knowledge in the same way.
=======
One of the key ideas underpining collective intelligence is to not force everyone to contribute their knowledge in the same way, so this pilot project will experiment with different approaches. 
>>>>>>> main:project/Contribute.md

In Phase 1 of the site (see [[Project plan]]), however, we're limiting contributions to:

<<<<<<< HEAD:project/How to contribute.md
* submit your personal profile via *this Google form??* (we'll have to do some post-processing, so this isn't our favourite)
* download a template(s) and send your file(s) to use (super simple)
* suggest an edit by simply [contacting us]([[Contact us]]) (against the spirit of collective intelligence, so not our favourite)
* become a massive.wiki contributor (very cool!)

Note: However you contribute your personal profile,  you'll need to know more about [[How we measure thinking tools]].

## Send in your files

### Submit your personal profile as a .md file

The easiest is to simply download this template ([[personal profile template]]), edit it locally and:

* email is to us via email@address??
* submit via this form??
* post it to our Mattermost channel??

Please follow the template. You can edit a markdown file using any text editor (Notepad, Obsidian, etc.). Any questions? [[Contact us]]

### Submit new tool or practice pages

If your personal profile mentions a tool or technique not already present in the map, download the appropriate template ([[tool template]], [[practice template]]), edit it locally and submit it (see above).

### Improve existing tool or practice pages

Would you like to improve an existing tool or practice page? Several options exist:

* [[How to comment]]
* go to the page and click *the "download this page in markdown format"* link, edit the file on your machine and submit it (see above).
* become a massive.wiki contributor (below - recommended)
=======
* become a massive.wiki contributor, below (recommended)
* suggest an edit via commenting (see [[comment on this site's content]]) 
* simply [contact us]([[Contact us]]). 
>>>>>>> main:project/Contribute.md

## Become a massive.wiki contributor

This site is a massive.wiki, which means you can:

* download its content into your own note-taking system in the form of markdown files
* do whatever you like with them on your personal machine
* contribute your edits and entirely new files back to the site
* get and then accept or reject any updates whenever anyone else contributes knowledge.

A full user manual is available on the [massive.wiki](http://massive.wiki) site, but in brief, you'll need:

* a GitHub account, so you can fork [[this site's repository]] of files
* Git on your computer, so you can 'pull' new versions of the files from the repository to your computer, and 'push' your edits back to it
* software to edit the markdown files: we recommend Obsidian, as its "Obsidian Git" plugin supports the previous step seamlessly, but massive.wiki works whatever tool you use.

## Future plans

In future Phases we aim to support some or all of the following options to contribute Personal profiles, Tool and Pracrtice pages, along with anything else we can collectively come up with:

* submit your personal profile via an online Google form (we'll have to do some post-processing, so this won't be our favourite)
* download a template(s) and send your file(s) to use (super simple)

### Send in your personal profile or *new* tool or practice pages

Submit your personal profile, along with any tool or practice pages not already mentioned, by downloading the appropriate template ([[personal profile template]], [[tool template]], [[practice template]]), edit it locally and:

* email is to us (see [[Contact us]])
* submit via this form (*to be created*)
* post it to this dedicated Mattermost channel (*to be created*) 

Please follow the template. You can edit a markdown file using any text editor (Notepad, Obsidian, etc.). Any questions? [[Contact us]]

### Improve existing tool or practice pages

Would you like to improve an existing tool or practice page? Several options exist:

* [[comment on this site's content]] (available in Phase 1)
* go to the page and click *the "download this page in markdown format"* link, edit the file on your machine and submit it (see above).
* become a massive.wiki contributor (above - recommended)

Note: However you contribute your personal profile,  you'll need to know more about [[measuring thinking tools]].
