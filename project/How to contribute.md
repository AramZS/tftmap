# How to contribute

**There are several ways to contribute to the map.**

One of the key ideas underpinning collective intelligence is to not force everyone to contribute their knowledge in the same way.

So you can:

* submit your personal profile via *this Google form??* (we'll have to do some post-processing, so this isn't our favourite)
* download a template(s) and send your file(s) to use (super simple)
* suggest an edit by simply [contacting us]([[Contact us]]) (against the spirit of collective intelligence, so not our favourite)
* become a massive.wiki contributor (very cool!)

Note: However you contribute your personal profile,  you'll need to know more about [[How we measure thinking tools]].

## Send in your files

### Submit your personal profile as a .md file

The easiest is to simply download this template ([[personal profile template]]), edit it locally and:

* email is to us via email@address??
* submit via this form??
* post it to our Mattermost channel??

Please follow the template. You can edit a markdown file using any text editor (Notepad, Obsidian, etc.). Any questions? [[Contact us]]

### Submit new tool or practice pages

If your personal profile mentions a tool or technique not already present in the map, download the appropriate template ([[tool template]], [[practice template]]), edit it locally and submit it (see above).

### Improve existing tool or practice pages

Would you like to improve an existing tool or practice page? Several options exist:

* [[How to comment]]
* go to the page and click *the "download this page in markdown format"* link, edit the file on your machine and submit it (see above).
* become a massive.wiki contributor (below - recommended)

## Become a massive.wiki contributor

This site is a massive.wiki, which means you can:

* download its content into your own note-taking system in the form of markdown files
* do whatever you like with them on your personal machine
* contribute your edits and entirely new files back to the site
* get and then accept or reject any updates whenever anyone else contributes knowledge.

A full user manual is available on the massive.wiki site??, but in brief, you'll need:

* a GitHub account, so you can fork [[this site repository]] of files
* Git on your computer, so you can 'pull' new versions of the files from the repository to your computer, and 'push' your edits back to it
* software to edit the markdown files: we recommend Obsidian, as its "Obsidian Git" plugin supports the previous step seamlessly, but massive.wiki works whatever tool you use.
