*version control*: 

* the site is currently **version 0**
* plan to be updated as the site develops
- from Pete: let's talk about how this version control section works.
	- this is version 0+n
	- see a similar idea at [Page History in YAML Frontmatter \- Developer Wiki](https://developer.massive.wiki/conversationswiki/page_history_in_yaml_frontmatter)

# Outline Project plan 

## Version 0: define, create mockup
### Peter, Bill & Mathew knock the basic idea around until it's ready for v1
* Create a first set of scoring dimensions, which will mean aligning various tables developed by various people 
	* martyr draft (ML)
	* airtable draft (all) - see [[airtable guidelines]]
* create enough data to create spidergraph v0 
* Get ML up to speed on massive.wiki (herculanean team effort)
* site mockup (ML).:
	* first draft site structure 
	* first draft content types (personal profiles, tools, practices, etc) & ancillary pages
	* no actual code, but shows how it will look  

### ToDo:
* vision statement (all)
* rewrite prototype content according to this plan (ML)
* create spidergraph mockup v0, add to home page (ML) - done
* Get Documentation to v1-ready state, including
	* basic massive.wiki documentation
	* [[airtable guidelines]]


## Version 1:  FoTL/OGM early adopters
### Two activities in parallel:
* Run a wider discussion with early adopters from FoTL/OGM community about the scoring dimensions, and achieve a consensus
* get basic code working and test it

When these two activities converge we will have Version 2.

### ToDo
* achieve consensus on dimensions on airtable
* The site actually works somewhat:
	* tool and practice files auto-populated with excerpts from personal profiles
	* data from personal profiles added to datastore?
	* spidergraph auto-updated from datastore?
	* homepage - see [[homepage spidergraph proposal]]: with embedded spidergraph (without user input form)
	* [[404 page process]] 
		* "A better 404 page" - already done
		* Automated template-driven page creation - if possible, otherwise for a later version
	* create [[known issues]] file
* test above using content from participants 
	* people profiles by all participants, using agreed dimensions, with support if needed
	* necessary tool and practice files edited
* refine site and documentation in light of experience and feedback, creating v2 of both. (understandable by friends of friends)

## Version 2:  Friends of friends

* Widen the circle of invitees to other people we know interested in the field. see Blog: [[2. Mapping the thinking tool landscape]] & [[3. Why you probably wonâ€™t use that thinking tool the same way as anyone else]]
* assess interest, support submitters, refine site, system & documentation

We might do this several times before the site is ready for...

## Version 3: Full launch
The site is promoted by all contributors.

Details TBD.

### Optional: 
*This may be outside project scope, could come later.* 

Add a system allowing non Obsidian / GitHub users to 
* submit their profile
* add tools and technique files
* provide scores

## Plan the next project

We should have plenty of ideas...
