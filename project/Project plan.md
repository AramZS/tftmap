# Outline Project plan - v1

This is one of several possible plans. It presupposed that we can actually get the site working before we show it to anyone. This is therefore not a good plan if the "preparation" phase is too onerous - see [[alternative project plan]].

*update (15/10): following meeting 12/10, we're going to try and implement this plan*

## Build
* Create a first set of scoring dimensions, which will mean aligning various tables developed by various people (ML)
* Get the site working, so anyone can see how the actual map could look
	* population of tool and technique files with excerpts from personal profiles 
		*  test by adding our profiles
		* edit referenced tool and technique pages
	* homepage (see [[homepage spidergraph proposal]])
	* [[404 page process]]
	* create [[known issues]] file
* Create Documentation: v1 (understandable by FoTL/OGM community), for...

## Launch 1: FoTL/OGM

* post an invite to Town Square & elsewhere on Mattermost
* assess interest
* support early adopters to contribute their content
* refine site and documentation in light of experience and feedback, creating v2 of both

## Launch 2: Friends of friends

* Widen the circle of invitees to other people we know interested in the field.
* as above:  assess interest, support submitters. refine site, system & documentation

We might do this several times before the site is ready for...

## Launch 3: Full launch

### Optional: 

*This may be outside project scope, could come later.* 

Add a system allowing non Obsidian / GitHub users to 
* submit their profile
* add tools and technique files
* provide scores

### Promotion

Publish blog posts. Currently:

* [[1. Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs]]
* [[2. Mapping the thinking tool landscape]]
* [[3. Why you probably wonâ€™t use that thinking tool the same way as anyone else]]

Blog process includes:

- Get all current contributors to help promote it
- Assess interest

## Plan the next project

We should have plenty of ideas...
