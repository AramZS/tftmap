# Outline Project plan - v1

This is one of several possible plans. It presupposed that we can actually get the site working before we show it to anyone. This is therefore not a good plan if the "preparation" phase is too onerous - see [[alternative project plan]].


## Build
* Create a first set of scoring dimensions, which will mean aligning various tables developed by various people
* Get the site working, so anyone can see how the actual map could look
	* Test it by adding our profiles, tools and techniques
	* Fine-tune, create [[known issues]] file
* Create Documentation: v1 (understandable by FoTL/OGM community), for...

## Launch 1: FoTL/OGM
* post an invite to Town Square & elsewhere on Mattermost
* assess interest
* support early adopters to contribute their content
* refine in light of experience and feedback to the
	* actual site
	* documentation, creating v2

## Launch 2: Friends of friends
* Widen the circle of invitees to other people we know interested in the field.
* as above:  assess interest, support submitters. refine site, system & documentation

We might do this several times before the site is ready for...

## Launch 3: Full launch
### Optional: 
*This may be outside project scope, could come later.* 

Add a system allowing non Obsidian / GitHub users to 
* submit their profile
* add tools and technique files
* provide scores

### Promotion
Publish blog posts. Currently:
	* [[1. Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs]]
	* [[2. Mapping the thinking tool landscape]]
	* [[3. Why you probably wonâ€™t use that thinking tool the same way as anyone else]]

Get all current contributors to help promote it
Assess interest

## Plan the next project
We should have plenty of ideas...
