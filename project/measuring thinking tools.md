# How we measure thinking tools

**The dimensions used to characterise thinking tools in the spidergraph on the [home page]([[README]]) need to find a balance between usability and granularity.**

This is unlikely to be an easy balance to find, as:
* the people *contributin*g this data know the tools well (and so will generally prefer granularity). 
* but *this map is aimed at newcomers*, for whom usability is more important as they try and find their way through this landscape.

# Version 0: "Mathew's Maiden Martyr Draft"

So version 0, below, tries to keep the number of dimensions to a minimum. As its unofficial title suggests its designed to spark discussion, so I'll see you on Mattermost:
