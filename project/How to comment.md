# How to comment

**In addition to contributing your own personal profile, tool and practice pages (see [[How to contribute]]), you can also contribute comments to existing content.**

Collective intelligence tools should of course allow people to comment in a number of ways. On the other hand,  too many commenting features will make the site unusable and fragment the conversation. As this is a pilot project, we're experimenting with different approaches. 

We *currently* support the following options:

* use the **comment form** at the bottom of each page;  
* or, you can contribute your version of the entire page (see below)  

In subsequent phases we may explore other options, particularly if the resulting conversation shows a more substantial collaboration is required - eg:

* set up the equivalent of a 'talk page' (cf wikipedia)  
* create a dedicated object on a separate platform best suited for the discussion, ranging from hackmd.io to airtable.com

## Contribute your version of the entire page

Arguably the most powerful, but also the most complex method. 

As set out in [[How to contribute#Become a Massive Wiki contributor|Become a Massive Wiki contributor]], you can clone this site's GitHub repository to your machine, edit any file you like and submit it back to the repository, where:

* we can use GitHub's commenting function to discuss your edits line by line in GitHub.
* or we can simply publish your changes, if they are inserted as comments, so that others can see and comment on them in turn. **Please simply follow the paragraph you're commenting on with a new version, indented and preceded by the date and your name.**

## Revision Notes

2023-01-11: (ML): 

* the other commenting options: it's what we discussed, but not for Phase 1, so I returned it with that caveat.
* other slight edits, incl. requirement to include date in comments submitted via page contribution

2023-01-08: (WLA removed this entire section. We do not have plans to support this for Phase 1. Or do we?)

* If the resulting conversation shows a more substantial collaboration is required, we  (or you) can:
	* set up the equivalent of a 'talk page' (cf wikipedia)  
	* create a dedicated object on a separate platform best suited for the discussion, ranging from hackmd.io to airtable.com
