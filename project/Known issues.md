## British Spellings

We have standardised on British spellings for Tool, Practice, and project pages. (We haven't decided about People pages yet.)

This will become part of a larger [[Style Guide for This Wiki]] page, which is not yet created.

## Name and Email Boxes for Comments Not Properly Spaced

The layout and spacing of the name and email boxes in the comment form is currently broken (squished together).  Our developers say something about "CSS, box model, it's harder than you think,"" blah, blah, blah.  It's on our to-do list to fix. If _you_ see what the CSS problem is (it's a little subtle), please let us know!
