# About this project
**This pilot, spawned by [Fellowship of the Link discussions](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/whw9kgizb7nifqbe6znu5cgrrr), is creating a decentralised map of thinking tools to demonstrate decentralised solutions to collective intelligence.** 

## Vision statement (tbd)

---

*ML first draft follows*

## Introduction
As explained in the first blog post  ([Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs](https://medium.com/@mathewlowry/building-collective-intelligence-from-social-knowledge-graphs-e3a465852e8b)), this is hopefully the first in *"a series of pilot projects where:*

- *the tools we have today are used to link ideas in a specific domain (and the people behind them) together in a decentralised way
- *in the process demonstrating decentralised collective intelligence*
- *we learn from the experience to create a new iteration of slightly better tools as a result, along with a slightly bigger audience,*
-  *rinse, repeat.*"

This particular pilot project is starting with massive.wiki. Future projects might try other solutions, or ideally expand this one to work with them.

**Why thinking tools?** See the third planned blog post: [[3. Why you probably wonâ€™t use that thinking tool the same way as anyone else]].

**And how will it work?** See the 2nd: [[2. Mapping the thinking tool landscape]], or simply click around.

## How will this map be structured?

You'll find examples of three types of file:

* a **personal profile** - eg [[Mathew Lowry]]. Ideally everyone who rates the tools for the spidergraph provides something like this, as each profile ties the other two types of file together with a story about how a real person actually uses them. It includes 
	* a series of bullets mentioning different tools and techniques; these will appear automatically in the appropriate tool and technique pages (below)
	* the scores they give each tool they use; these are automatically added to the datastore which powers the spidergraph on the [home page]([[README]]) 
* **two types of zettelkasten overview**
	* **pratice:** this describes a thinking tool practice, eg [[inbox curation]] It includes a brief description, link(s) and an automatically created list of the people who use this practice, along with the associated bullet from their profile describing *how* they use it
	* **tool**: similar to a practice, but describes a thinking tool, eg [[roam]] or [[Pocket]], and
		* the automated list of people profiles which use it, along with the associated bullet from their profile describing how they use it
		* **the scores they gave it** (only actual scores included; blanks are not imported).

The 2nd blog post ([[2. Mapping the thinking tool landscape]]) has a visual showing how these all link together:

**Personal profiles are key** because newcomers need stories as well as scores, so each profile gives a newcomer someone to learn from: *How do they combine Which tools and practice together*? 

And in every file, of course, each mention of any tool or practice links to the zettelkasten overview for that tool or practice, where users get both:

* a description of the tool / practice
* links to explore how different people use it, and the scores they gave to it
