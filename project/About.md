# About this project
**This pilot, spawned by [[Fellowship of the Link]] discussions, is creating a partially decentralised map of thinking tools to demonstrate decentralised solutions to collective intelligence.** 

## Introduction
As explained in one of the blog posts planned (and currently open for comments: [[1. Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs]]), this is hopefully the first in "a series of pilot projects where:
-   the tools we have today are used to link ideas in a specific domain (and the people behind them) together in a decentralised way
-   in the process demonstrating decentralised collective intelligence
-   we learn from the experience to create a new iteration of slightly better tools as a result, along with a slightly bigger audience,
-   rinse, repeat."

This particular pilot project is starting with massive.wiki. Future projects might try other solutions, or ideally expand this one to work with them.

Why thinking tools? See the third blog post planned: [[3. Why you probably wonâ€™t use that thinking tool the same way as anyone else]].

And how will it work? See the 2nd: [[2. Mapping the thinking tool landscape]].

***All blog posts are open for comments: just use massive.wiki to submit your suggested changes, and we can discuss them in GitHub.***

## How will this map be structured?

You'll find in this repository (and, eventually, wiki), examples of three types of file:
* a **personal profile** - eg [[Mathew Lowry]]. Ideally everyone who rates the tools for the spidergraph provides something like this, as each profile ties the other two types of file together with a story about how a real person actually uses them. It includes 
	* a series of bullets mentioning different tools and techniques; these will appear automatically in the appropriate tool and technique pages (below)
	* the scores they give each tool they use; these are automatically added to the datastore which powers the spidergraph on the [home page]([[README]]) 
* **two types of zettelkasten overview**
	* **technique:** this describes a thinking tool technique, eg [[inbox curation]] It includes a brief description, link(s) and an automatically created list of the people who use this technique, along with the associated bullet from their profile describing how they use it
	* **tool**: similar to a technique, but describes a thinking tool, eg [[roam]] or [[Pocket]], and
		* the automated list of people profiles which use it, along with the associated bullet from their profile describing how they use it
		* **the scores they gave it** (only actual scores included; blanks are not imported).

The 2nd blog post ([[2. Mapping the thinking tool landscape]]) has a visual showing how these all link together:

**Personal profiles are key** because newcomers need stories as well as scores, so each profile gives a newcomer someone to learn from: *how do they combine which tools and techniques together*? 

And in every file, of course, each mention of any tool or technique links to the zettelkasten overview for that tool or technique, where users get both 
* a description of the tool / technique
* links to explore how different people use it, and the scores they gave to it
