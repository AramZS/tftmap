# How to use this site
**This site presents the collective knowledge of NN?? [[Users]] about the thinking tools they use.** 

Here's how to tap that knowledge.

## Describe your ideal thinking tool in 6?? numbers
Everyone contributing to this map rates the thinking tools they use using the following dimensions:
* DimensionName: explanation
* DimensionName: explanation
* DimensionName: explanation
* DimensionName: explanation
* DimensionName: explanation
* DimensionName: explanation

[[More on those dimensions]]

The aggregated scores are displayed in the spidergraph on the [Home Page]([[README]]). So:
* use the form alongside it to set your personal priorities
* hit ENTER: your personal priorities appear on the graph in red (label: "Me")
* identify **your personal shortlist**: the tool(s) which best match *your* priorities.

*example image*
For example, this visitor prioritises DimensionName and DimensionName, so Tool1 and Tool2 should be on her shortlist.

## Explore your shortlisted tools... 
All tools can be found via the [[Tools]] menu, which points to each tool's Tool Page.  This briefly describes the tool and includes brief excerpts from - and links to - the personal profiles of all users who use that tool.

## ... and their users...
So follow the links to the personal profiles and explore how different people integrate that particular tool into their **personal productivity system**. 

You'll quickly find that each such system is unique. 

## ... and their techniques
One reason for this is that personal productivity systems are not just composed of tools - they include techniques, too. There are probably hundreds of productivity techniques: we currently list  NN?? in the [[Techniques]] menu. 

All thinking tools support one or some of these techniques to some degree, so choosing the right tool depends partly on identifying which techniques matter most to you, and which tool supports those techniques best.

Each technique is described in a Technique page. Like Tool pages, they include a brief description of the technique, followed by brief excerpts from - and links to - the personal profiles of all users who use that technique.

In this way you can browse from a tool to a profile of someone who uses that tool to a technique that person uses to the profile of another person who uses that technique to a tool that person uses, and so on.

Enjoy!
